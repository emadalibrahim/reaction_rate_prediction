# Reaction Rate Prediction

This repository contains the transfer model, training script, and data needed to reproduce results described in "A transfer learning approach to multi-target temperature-dependent reaction rate prediction". To reproduce the base model use the code provided in: \url{https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop} and follow the procedure reported in "Analyzing Learned Molecular Representations for Property Prediction".

An example run can be found in "Reaction_Rate_Prediction.ipynb".
